# time-sum
This is an answer to a question I overheard. Basically what sum of numbers would appear the most if you counted all of the possible time formations on a clock (not counting secs) So for example 08:43 -> 15 
For clearification -
12 AM is counted as 00:00, not as 24:00 and every PM is counted just like a digital clock would. (1 PM -> 13:00; 11 PM -> 23:00)
